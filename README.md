# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Project Overview
In this project, we will explore the authentication process and implement Basic Authentication on a simple API. While it's recommended to use established frameworks and modules for production-grade systems, this project focuses on building a Basic Authentication system from scratch for learning purposes.

## Background Context
- Learn the fundamentals of Basic Authentication.
- Understand the Base64 encoding mechanism and its role in authentication.
- Explore HTTP headers and how they relate to user authentication.

## Resources
You can refer to the following resources for better understanding:
- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-rest-api/)
- [Base64 in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/base64.html)
- [HTTP header Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Base64 - Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain what authentication means.
- Describe Base64 encoding and its purpose.
- Encode and decode strings in Base64.
- Implement a simple Basic Authentication mechanism.
- Handle the `Authorization` HTTP header.

## Project Requirements
- Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- All files should follow the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5)
- All modules, classes, and functions should be documented using descriptive docstrings.
