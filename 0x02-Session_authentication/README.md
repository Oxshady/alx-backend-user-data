# 0x02. Session Authentication

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing a **Session Authentication** mechanism to understand the foundational concepts of managing user sessions without relying on third-party modules or frameworks. The goal is to build a session-based authentication system from scratch, focusing on concepts such as cookies, session management, and secure authentication.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what authentication means and how session-based authentication works.
- Explain what cookies are, how to send and receive them, and how to parse them.
- Implement a basic session-based authentication system using Python and Flask.
  
## Resources

- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms - Session Authentication](https://example.com)
- [HTTP Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Flask Cookie](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#cookies)

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.7
- **OS**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Code Style**: Pycodestyle (version 2.5)
- **Scripts**:
  - All scripts should be executable and include `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as the first line.
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: This README file.
- **Session Authentication Scripts**: Each Python script implements a specific part of the session authentication mechanism. All modules, classes, and functions are documented with clear explanations of their purpose and usage.

## Code Documentation

- **Modules**: Each module is documented to describe its purpose.
- **Classes**: Every class has a docstring explaining its functionality.
- **Functions**: Each function, whether inside or outside a class, includes a docstring describing its role and behavior.

This project is a hands-on approach to understanding session-based authentication mechanisms, equipping you with the knowledge to implement secure user authentication for back-end applications.
